### Docker Networks: DNS
You are gonna learn about DNS, and how it affects containers in custom networks and default networks. 

* Having good DNS is important because we can't rely on IP addresses to inside containers since things are so dynamic.

* DNS is the standard for how we do intercommunication between containers on the same host and across host.

* It is recommended to create custom networks rather than using `--link` all the time
